# Social_Network_Server
## Simple social network server and client
this is the server implementation, the client implementation is in the Social_Network_Client repository.

Registered users can log in to the system, follow other users, post messages and send private messages to other users. 
The server is implemented in two methods – Thread-Per-Client and Reactor pattern. 



### command lines:

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="bgu.spl.net.impl.BGSServer.TPCMain" -Dexec.args="<port>"  

for reactor:  
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="bgu.spl.net.impl.BGSServer.ReactorMain" -Dexec.args="<Num of threads> <port>"  

#### Client:
